the idea of BrowserAuth is to use only BrowserId, and no OAuth. it describes what Sauropod does to allow access to a data zone.

i think there's a problem with it though, because if i want to phish, i can present the user a browserid button, and put in the wrong audience... ah no, the browser or shim would stop that. i think. ok, let's assume you can only give the audience that you are yourself hosted on, as an app.

then we could package apps: contacts.guardcat.org/supercat/index.html, where supercat is the guardcat app. adapting the demo...
hm, 'category' is no longer a good name if only the guardcat apps fall into categories from a user's point of view.

thinking about this again, guardcat.org should be the app, and contacts.unhosted.org should be the namespace. and 'category' stops making sense as a name for an app's data scope, but on the bright side, we will be able to just use '{app}' instead
in fact, there is no reason to append '.unhosted.org' if we're never going to browserid to them.
