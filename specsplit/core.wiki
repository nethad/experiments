= Personal Data Service specification =

Given a Personal Data Service defined by:
* Service type (a string)
* scopes (a regular expression)
* details (a hash table)

an auth&disco server should implement a discovery service that, when given a service type and a user address, leads to the discovery of:
- whether such a service exists for that user address
- if so,
  - the auth mechanisms available for obtaining tokens for it
  - its service details


Recognized discovery mechanisms and their interpretation are (this list is to be maintained on the unhosted cg wiki at w3c):

* pds-webfinger-2012.04 : pds-webfinger-2012.04
=========
In the lrdd record of webfinger there should be a resource with class 'personal-data-service', a type attribute for the services type, and one attribute per element of the 'details' hash table.
=========


Recognized auth mechanisms and their interpretation are (this list is to be maintained on the unhosted cg wiki at w3c):

* pds-oauth-2012.04 : pds-oauth-2012.04
=========
The OAuth dialog should accept the scopes as defined by said regular expression, and create a token for the scopes the user chooses to allow. This token should then both be given to the client (the app) as the bearer token, and the applicable (token, scope) tuples should be inserted into the service's grants table.
