    <h2>Libre Docs Advanced Freedom</h2>
    Libre Docs does not store your data. You need to bring your own remote storage to the party. There are several ways for you to get a remote storage account that will work in combination with Libre Docs:
    <ul>
      <li>Get your own CouchDB instance at Iris Couch. Even though this is only one of the options, we recommend Iris Couch because they are nice people, who care about the open web and about decentralization of control. You can always start with this option, and switch to a more advanced one later. To sign up, go <a href="/">back</a> and click the 'Easy Freedom' button.</li>
      <li>Run <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> yourself and run our <a href="/pimper.html">Couch Pimper</a> against it.</li>
      <li>Run <a href="http://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a> and pay special attention to point 4, as well as to the last paragraph, of the <a href="http://owncloud.org/install/">instructions</a>.</li>
      <li>You can also link storage to your WordPress installation, using this (experimental) <a href="https://github.com/unhosted/experiments/tree/master/wp-plugin">WordPress plugin</a>. Note that you will still need either CouchDB or ownCloud somewhere to work in combination with this.</li>
      <li>Develop your own software, or make existing software compatible with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/unhosted/wiki/RemoteStorage">remoteStorage</a> standard.</li>
    </ul>
