Terms of Service

Welcome to Delicious, a service being provided to you by Yahoo! Inc. ("Delicious"). By accessing or otherwise using Delicious you agree and acknowledge to be bound by these Delicious Terms of Service ("Delicious Terms"). If you do not agree to these Delicious Terms or to our Privacy Policy located at http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/delicious/, please do not access Delicious. As of April 25th, 2011, Delicious is owned by AVOS. During a transition period, the Delicious site will continue to be run by Yahoo! and your Delicious account information will be subject to these Delicious Terms. You will have the opportunity to transfer your account information to AVOS during this transition period, and if you agree to the transfer, your account information will, once transferred, be subject to AVOS's Terms of Service. Delicious reserves the right to change these Delicious Terms at any time. Delicious recommends that you periodically check this page.

1. Usage License

<span class="limited-rights">

Delicious grants you a limited license to access and use Delicious in accordance with these Delicious Terms and the instructions and guidelines 
posted on Delicious. 
</span>
<span class="mayChange">
Delicious reserves the right to terminate your license to use Delicious at any time and for any reason or to charge for 
commercial usage in the future.
</span>

2. User Responsibility
<span class="youResponsibleForYourConduct">

You are solely responsible for your use of Delicious. Because Delicious merely serves as a repository of information, user-posted content does not 
represent the advice, views, opinions or beliefs of Yahoo!, and Delicious makes no claim of accuracy of any user-posted material. Delicious allows 
for the posting of links to third-party websites. The linked websites' content, business practices and privacy policies are not under the control of 
Delicious, and Delicious is not responsible for the content of any linked website or any link contained in a linked website. The inclusion of a link 
on Delicious does not imply any endorsement by or any affiliation with Delicious. In accessing Delicious or following links to third-party websites 
you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive or inappropriate. You agree that your only recourse is to stop using Delicious.
</span>
<span class="MustNotSpam">
You understand that the creation of bookmarks in Delicious for purposes of specifically boosting exposure of a site in Delicious and/or 
search engines is a breach of these Delicious Terms, that Delicious views such entries as spam and that Delicious reserves the right to take 
appropriate action to restrict such entries up to and including termination of your access to Delicious.
</span>

3. User-Posted Content

<span class="allowWhateverForService"> 	<span class="allowWhateverForService3dParty">
By posting content, you are granting permission to Delicious and others to access and use it in connection with Delicious and otherwise in connection 
with its affiliates’ businesses. 
</span>
<span class="sharing-your-stuff-public-private>
You can mark content as private to restrict access and use to those users to whom you explicitly grant access. For 
publicly accessible content, you can label your content with one of several possible licenses. 
</span>
<span class="allowWhateverForService3dParty">
Your use of a license in connection with your content does not affect Delicious' right to access and use it in connection with Delicious or otherwise 
in connection with its affiliates’ businesses.
</span>
<span class="noWarranty">	<span class="useAtOwnRisk"> 	<span class="notResponsibleDamage">
Delicious does not provide legal services, and therefore, providing you with the ability to attach a license agreement to your compilation of links 
does not create an attorney-client relationship. The license agreements and all related information are provided on an "as is" basis. Delicious makes 
no warranties whatsoever regarding the license agreements and the information provided, and disclaims all liability for damages, including without 
limitation, any general, special, incidental or consequential damages, resulting from their use. Delicious will include this license label in making 
your content accessible to others, but any enforcement of your chosen license terms remains your sole responsibility.
</span>
<span class="bewarePublicIsPublic"> 
Delicious is explicitly not responsible for the manner or circumstances by which third parties access or use public content and is under no 
obligation to disable or otherwise restrict this access. 
</span>
<span class="intended-service"> <span class="limited-rights">
Delicious provides you with the ability to retrieve and remove your posted content and your 
personal information from Delicious. This ability does not extend to copies that others may have made or to copies that Delicious may have made for 
backup purposes.
</span>

4. Feeds and API
<span class="Feeds-API"> 	<span class="mayChange"> <span class="exposure-of-content">
Delicious provides access to portions of Delicious via RSS feeds and an API; for the purposes of these Delicious Terms, such access constitutes use 
of Delicious. Delicious asks that you use these features respectfully, as outlined in the documentation. You may not use these or any other features 
or Delicious itself to allow the display of a substantial portion of the Delicious database or reproduce, duplicate or copy Delicious. Delicious 
reserves the right to change these features at any time and to disable access to the feeds and the API at any time for any reason.
