    <h2>Coming soon</h2>
    <p>Opentabs.net is a free software tool to help the 99% of us be less dependent on abusive banking fees. Private alpha launch is <strong>this Saturday</strong>!</p>

    <h2>Sign up for an invite</h2>
    Your email address: <input type="email" id="email"><input type="submit" id="button" onclick="submit();" value="Be a part of this">

    <h2>Opentabs.net</h2>
    <p>Imagine you owe me money from, say, a train ticket that I bought for you. We then have two options: if it was a small amount, we can decide to forget about it (gift economy), but if it was any noteworthy sum, then we would probably end up using the Plain Old Banking System to settle this little peer-to-peer transaction. People use banking between friends, between house mates, and even between family members, and abusive banking fees play too big a role in our day-to-day life. This has to stop. With Opentabs.net there will be a third option: just tab it!</p>

     <p>You can tab amounts of money, beers, hours of work, bitcoins, books, whatever you want to leave unpaid. Just like when you tell the waiter in a bar to put a round of drinks &quot;on your tab&quot;, Opentabs.net is a tool for having tabs open with your peers, until it cancels out against something else.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
     <p>The Opentabs.net web app does not make actual transactions. It is not a currency, and it is not a bank. It just helps you to cryptographically sign open tabs (&quot;IOUs&quot;) between peers, as an alternative to actually executing a bank transfer. This way we can both forget about that train ticket you owe me, and strike it off against other transactions, until maybe at the end of the year we clear the balance once, and settle the tab. Just like tabs in a bar.</p>
     <p>We will launch in private alpha <strong>this Saturday</strong>, to coincide with Bank Transfer Day, Mozilla Festival, and Guy Fawkes Day. We're working around the clock to get everything ready for you, just sign up above. More info will become available during the launch.</p>
