- use proxy instead of multiple APIs
- you will need search, because lazy loading of B-tree chunks into client-side will always be slow
- finish the bloody example apps! backbone-js like code example (2-column). then people will write apps
- listen to localStorage from an iframe - possible?
- unhosted day as hackathon
- personal information manager (pim) - calendar, address book
- bearer token to email address
- offer proxying hosting: webfinger (email-relay?), oauth, cors.
- user chooses their own storage and links it into bearstech control panel
- deltacloud - abstraction proxy
- focus on private data, forget about public data. it's a separate problem with its own issues
- readcaps are persistent tokens, not one-time tokens. avoid them
- automate unhosting of localStorage app completely.
- make autocomplete work on our login-div
